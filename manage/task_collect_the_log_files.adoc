You can collect log files for ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere from the option available in the VSC graphical user interface (GUI). Technical support might ask you to collect the log files to help troubleshoot a problem.

*About this task*

If you need VASA Provider log files, you can generate a support bundle from the Vendor Provider Control Panel screen. This page is part of the VASA Provider maintenance menus, which are accessible from the virtual appliance's console.

`\https://vm_ip:9083`
[NOTE]
When you are not able to access the web interface, use the *Enable SSH Access* option in the maintenance console, see link:../configure/reference_maintenance_console_of_ontap_tools_for_vmware_vsphere.html[Maintenance console options for ONTAP tools]. After the SSH is enabled you can access the ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere appliance using a SFTP client.

You can collect the VSC log files by using the "`Export VSC Logs`" feature in the VSC GUI. When you collect a VSC log bundle with VASA Provider enabled, the VSC log bundle will also have the VP logs. The following steps tell you how to collect the VSC log files:

*Steps*

. From the ONTAP tools home page, click *Configuration* > *Export VSC Logs*.
+
This operation can take several minutes.

. When prompted, save the file to your local computer.

You can then send the _.zip_ file to technical support.
